    "ValidProjectContext": "This project aims to develop a web application for a pet accessories business. The platform will allow users to explore and purchase a variety of products designed for the well-being and entertainment of their pets, such as collars, toys, beds, clothing, and more. The application is aimed at pet owners who want to purchase products conveniently, quickly, and securely from anywhere. It focuses especially on offering an easy-to-use experience, both for users with basic technology skills and for those who frequently shop online. The platform will be available through any web browser, on computers, tablets, or mobile devices, without the need to download an app. It will be accessible from anywhere with an internet connection, allowing customers to browse the catalog, add products to their cart, make secure payments, and track the status of their orders. In addition, the system will feature an administrative panel so the business can manage its inventory, update products, fulfill orders, and analyze sales. In this way, the company seeks to digitize the sales and customer service process, improving the business's online presence and facilitating its growth.",
